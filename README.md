This project is an example of an order management system that uses a SQL database.

## Project structure

## Getting the project up and running

1. Install a SQL database (e.g. MySQL).
2. Run the SQL scripts in the "scripts" folder in the correct order to create the tables in the database.
3. Use the SQL query files located in the "queries" folder to manipulate the data in the database.
4. If you want to use views, execute SQL queries from the "views" folder to create the appropriate views.

## Requirements

- SQL database (e.g. MySQL)
- SQL client or database management tool (e.g. MySQL Workbench)
